    "text": "Bradley-Terry models\nWikipedia defines a Bradley-Terry model as:\n\\[\\Pr(i &gt; j) = \\frac{a_i}{a_i + a_j}\\]\nWhere\n\n\n\\(\\Pr(i &gt; j)\\) is the probability of a pairwise comparison of element i vs element j is true; e.g. in an MMA match between fighter i and fighter j, fighter i wins\n\n\\(a_i = e^{\\beta_i}\\), where \\(\\beta_i\\) is a real value assigned to element i; e.g. the skill of fighter i\n\nWhen transformed to the log-odds scale we get:\n\\[\\operatorname{logit}(\\Pr(i &gt; j)) = \\beta_i - \\beta_j\\]\nIt seems that this class of models describes the UFClefties question. Andy Milne describes how to parameterize this class of models for brms in this stan forum post; essentially we need a \\(\\beta\\) variable for each fighter with a value of 1 if the fighter won the match, a value of-1 if the fighter lost, and a value of 0 otherwise. Adding handedness gives the following model\n\\[\\operatorname{logit}(\\Pr(i &gt; j)) = L + \\beta_i - \\beta_j\\]\nWhere \\(L\\) denotes the ‘lefty advantage’ and encodes the diasteriomeric relation of the match; \\(L\\) takes the following values:\n\n0 when a righty fights a righty or a lefty fights a lefty\n1 when a lefty wins over a righty\n-1 when a righty wins over a lefty\n\nAre we actually going to get much info on fighter ability from going about it this way? Let’s poke a bit at the data to find out."

For fun, let’s re-run the model using only the largest cluster:\n\nCoded.92 &lt;- d[UFClefties$fighter1 %in% (as.integer(fighters$connected_N == 92) * 1:244),]\n\nBT92_model &lt;- brm(\n  formula = bf(Y ~ 0 + ., family = bernoulli),\n  prior = prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),\n  data = d.92, \n  chains = chains,\n  iter = iter,\n  warmup = warmup,\n  seed = (seed &lt;- as.integer(Sys.time())))\n\n\nThe seed used is {r} print(seed).\nTrace and trank plots look fine for these models; they will not be reproduced here."

    "text": "Conclusion\nSo in this case adding information on fighter ability didn’t affect the posterior distribution much, and probably didn’t contain much information given the small size of the clusters, and low average number of fights for each fighter, but it was an interesting exercise. Some parting thoughts:\n\nThe exercise illustrated the limited expressive power of brms relative to Stan and the Rethinking package; models will be difficult to express in brms unless they can be coerced into a design matrix, as Wilkinson notation fundamentally is about converting a formula to a design matrix.\nPerhaps the “footedness” of the fighters might provide more info? This would complicate the diasteriomeric relations in each match, as each would then be a relation between four chiral centers, but perhaps the strikes from the lower body are more important than those from the upper body."
